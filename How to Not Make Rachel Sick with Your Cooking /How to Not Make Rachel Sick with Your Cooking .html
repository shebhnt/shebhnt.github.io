<p># How to Not Make Rachel Sick with Your Cooking</p></p>## Allergic To:</p>- Wheat</p>- Soy</p>- Raw Apples</p>- Raw Celery</p>- Raw Carrots</p>- Raw Melons</p>- Raw Kiwi</p>- Raw Hazelnuts</p>- Raw Macadamia nuts</p>- Raw Almonds</p>## Sensitive To:</p>- Dairy (see Notes)</p>- Vegetable Oil</p>- Canola Oil</p>- Peanuts</p>## Some Things I Can Eat:</p>- Sweet Potatoes</p>- Potatoes</p>- Brussel Sprouts</p>- Broccoli</p>- Spinach</p>- Peas</p>- Red Meat (not a ton)</p>- Chicken</p>- Fish</p>- Enjoy Life Chocolate Chips</p></p>### Helpful hint on avoiding wheat and soy</p>Just because something says it is "Gluten Free" does not mean it is Soy free.  Most things will now say if they contain soy or wheat where they list their ingredients.</p></p>Most prepackaged seasonings and processed foods will contain wheat, soy, or both.  Please always double check the ingredients if you are not sure.</p></p>Also note that most things that have chocolate in it and Mayo has soy in it as well.  I know, you are so jealous of my allergies right now aren't you?</p></p>### Remember that you can still make most recipes, you just need to subsitute some things to remove any wheat or soy.</p></p>*Note: Some dairy is ok like cheese but I can't have too much. Can't have heavy creams/dips </body>
