						<h3>How we came to Be</h3>
						<p>In 2014, The National African American Missions Conference (NAAMC) emerged from the partnership of Boundless Ministries Inc., formally Great Commission Global Ministries (GCGM) and SIM USA.</p>
                        <p>GCGM was established in 1998, under the auspices of Founder and President Bishop David T.P. Perrin, now known as Boundless Ministries Inc. Boundless Ministries Inc. not only hosts Missions conferences and trips, but also educates, trains, and sends people around the world who have a desire to share the Gospel. </p>
                        <p>SIM USA was founded by pioneers who were committed to spreading the Gospel to unreached people groups in Africa, Asia, South America, and beyond. Over 100 years later, under the leadership of President Bruce Johnson, SIM USA continues to operate with the same passion as the previous founders.</p>
						<p>Today, NAAMC provides an annual platform where participants from around the world can strengthen their skills through networking, education, and training, while enjoying speakers, exhibits, and various ministries. The quintessential goal of the conference is to minister to the hearts of African Americans who have an interest in serving as missionaries and to provide the resources necessary to help them fulfill the Great Commission.</p>
						<p>This year’s conference we will be announcing a NAAMC Certification Program. It will be launched in 2018. This will be an ongoing program throughout the year as a resource center for collaboration, networking, education, training and forming permanent partnerships in missions. </p>

                                <h3><strong>D</strong>isciple</h3>
								<p>Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.” Matthew 9:37 (NIV)</p>
                                <p>According the U.S. Census Bureau, African Americans make up 15% of the U.S. population.  Of that 15%, only 1% of African Americans works or participates in Global Missions.</p>
                                <p>NAAMC recognizes that African Americans are an under-represented voice on the Mission field.  NAAMC offers a platform to equip, train, and empower those who desire to engage in the Great Commission. As Christians we are called to serve!  Missions is Our DNA!  When and where is your next harvest?  Join us! There is plenty to be done throughout the world!</p>

								<p>“For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.” Matthew 18:20 (NIV).</p>
                                <p>NAAMC offers you the opportunity to network with other believers. Our goal is to create a setting full of spirited energy where everyone can come together to connect and share their missions experiences.  While attending NAAMC you will meet leaders and teachers who have spent years on the Mission field laboring for Christ.  As you interact throughout the conference, you will quickly recognize the “like DNA” in the hearts of your fellow attendees.</p>

								<p>“He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation."  Mark 16:15 (NIV).</p>
                                <p>Our love for Christ and His teachings moves us to go out and minister to the needs of those in our communities and in impoverished nations.  As we work to mobilize the local church, and prepare to serve in Global Missions, we should be actively listening for and responding to the call to serve, which is also an act of obedience.   Faith in action pleases God!  It shows compassion, shines light in dark places, and allows us to use our spiritual gifts and talents to change the world by truly being the hands and feet of Jesus.</p>
