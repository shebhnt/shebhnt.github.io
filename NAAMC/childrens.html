						<h3>Utopia Diabe</h3>
						<p>Utopia Diabe -16 years old, a Minnesota native, a junior at Lanham Christian High School has been on the mission field (locally and internationally) at an early age of six years old. She accepted Christ at a young age and was introduced to the mission field by her mother, Founder and Executive Director of Dorcas Works International, who organized Toys for Tots drives, food drives and back to school drives for underprivileged families in Minnesota, partnering with the US Marines, Feed my Starving Children, Minneapolis Police Department, Here’s Life Inner City and Operation Classrooms. Utopia served on the distribution team handing toys out during Christmas time, accompanying her mother from door to door delivering Thanksgiving meals to families in North Minneapolis where she grew up. After relocating to Maryland in 2011 for her mom’s job, at age 10, Utopia travelled to Haiti and Liberia to serve in hospitals, schools and orphanages.  She has led several drives (soap, food, clothing etc.) for projects in Haiti and Liberia. She is constantly collecting items in good condition to be shipped to Haiti or Liberia.  Since 2011, Utopia travels to Haiti and lives in the village with the village kids and hosts a Christmas Party for kids. She collects toys and does a fundraiser. Utopia is also very industrious. She sews clothes and braids hair and uses the proceeds to buy school supplies, clothes, medical supplies and pay for medical bills for patients when she travels to Haiti and Liberia. She has spoken at several youth meetings, appeared on the front cover of the PG Gazette and the Baltimore Sun and she has spoken at “Let the Healing Begin” Women's Conference.  Her message to youth is:</p>
						<p>“We are privileged in America. You are not too young to aid those in need. When you travel, live and experience the daily struggles with other children in these countries, you will honor and fear God. It also evokes a certain respect and appreciation for your parents, your teachers and elders.”</p>
						<p>Utopia currently resides in Maryland with her mother. Her long term career goal is to be a defense lawyer and prosecutor turned Judge in order to end the unfair criminal justice system in America. She will give alternative sentences for minor aggressions and eventually rise to the level of Supreme Court Justice. </p>
