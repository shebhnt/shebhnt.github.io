				<h3>How Missions Can Be a Family Affair?</h3>
				<p><strong>Richard Coleman: TMS Global Missionary</strong></p>
				<p>“Are you taking your kids with you?” Believe it or not, this is a common and comical question I receive when telling people about my plans to serve overseas. Perhaps this is because some all-too-often perceive calling in terms of the individual and forget that God calls entire families. Whether we plan to serve locally or internationally, missions can be a family affair. My hope is to inspire others to make missions involvement a family affair and not just something we approach from an individualistic standpoint. We will also look at practical ways to engage the whole family in local and international missions.</p>

				<p><strong>Belynda Gentry</strong></p>
